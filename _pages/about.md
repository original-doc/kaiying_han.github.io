I'm a senior year undergraduate student from the Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My research interest includes computer vision, multimedia and machine learning.

I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof. Fangxin Wang at CUHK Shenzhen since my junior year, focusing on 3D video generation and transmission. Moreover, it was a pleasure to join the FishSense team at UC San Diego as a summer intern, where I contributed to underwater instance segmentation under the supervision of Prof. Ryan Kastner. 

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position for the Fall 2025 term. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.

You can find my CV here: [Kaiying Han's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
